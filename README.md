# My Zed Editor Dojo ðŸ¥‹

This repository is my dedicated space for intentionally learning and mastering the Zed code editor.

## "Why" Zed

My goal is to become proficient with an editor that is simple, fast, and strikes a balance between keyboard-centric and mouse-friendly workflows. I am intentionally choosing an editor with fewer plugins at this stage to force myself to write more code and build foundational skills. As I grow in confidence, I will begin to integrate more advanced features like AI chat and extended plugin support.

## Core Features to Master

Initial checklist to tracks my progress on mastering the essential features of Zed.

### Navigation
- [ ] **Fuzzy Finding:** Open any file quickly (`Cmd-P`).
- [ ] **Buffer Navigation:** Switch between open files efficiently.
- [ ] **Go to Symbol:** Jump to any function or struct in a file (`Cmd-Shift-O`).
- [ ] **Go to Definition:** Jump to the definition of a variable or function.

### Editing
- [ ] **Multiple Cursors:** Edit multiple lines at once.
- [ ] **Expand/Shrink Selection:** Intelligently select blocks of code.
- [ ] **Code Actions:** Use Zed's built-in refactoring tools (rename symbol, etc.).
- [ ] **Commenting:** Quickly comment and uncomment lines and blocks.

### Integrated Tools
- [ ] **Command Palette:** Access any command without knowing the keybinding (`Cmd-Shift-P`).
- [ ] **Integrated Terminal:** Use the built-in terminal effectively.
- [ ] **Project Search:** Find text across the entire project.

### Advanced & Customization
- [ ] **Vim Mode:** (Optional) Explore using Zed's Vim emulation layer.
- [ ] **Collaboration:** Use Zed's built-in collaboration channels to code with someone in real-time.
- [ ] **Configuration:** Confidently edit `settings.json` and `keymap.json`.

## My Customizations Log

A running log of my personal tweaks and the reasoning behind them.

* **Keybinding:** Changed `...` to `...` because I find it more ergonomic for `...`.
* **Setting:** Enabled `...` to always show `...`.
